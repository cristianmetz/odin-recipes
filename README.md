PROJECT:RECIPES

In this project i will be building a basic recipe website.

This website consists of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

1. Utalizing HTML to list ingredients by order or unordered.
2. Inserting absolute images with alt attributes to discribe them for better accessability.
3. Using the target attribute to keep the user on the index site and open the recipes in a new tab.
4. Inserting link referencing relative websites.
5. Utalizing figure and figcaption for symantic HTML
